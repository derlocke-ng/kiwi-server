# The control node

One node at home runs kiwi-server by itself, so the fleet needs no desktop
that is always on. It has a page for the phone: `https://control.<host>`,
open to the mesh only.

It looks at every machine every ten minutes, sends the role to RAM masters
that booted, and runs what you start from the page: status, plan, apply,
check. Every change is in its log.

## Set it up

```yaml
papaya:
  node:
    modules: [vpn-client, reverse-proxy, control]
```

```bash
kiwi-server secrets init ~/kiwi/fleet.yaml            # once: the secrets become the encrypted store
kiwi-server serve ~/kiwi/fleet.yaml --set-password    # the password that opens it on the node
kiwi-server apply ~/kiwi/fleet.yaml papaya            # the module
kiwi-server control push ~/kiwi/fleet.yaml            # the fleet, encrypted, to the node
```

Then, from a device on the VPN: `https://control.papaya.<domain>`. The first
login opens the fleet.

## Secrets

Nothing rests on the node in the clear. Its disk holds `secrets.age` and
`fleet.yaml.age`, encrypted for the store's keys, and a salt.

| | |
|---|---|
| The password | makes an age key (scrypt, with the salt); that key is one of the store's keys. No hash of it and no key file is stored. |
| Logging in | opens the store and the fleet file into RAM inside the container. Job logs and rendered stacks stay in RAM too. |
| A restart, a power cut, **Lock** | locked again: the node does nothing by itself until the next login. |
| A stolen disk | holds encrypted files; each guess at the password costs scrypt (64 MiB). Use a long one: 12 characters at least. |

So after a power cut someone logs in once, from the phone. Use a disk
encrypted with a ring as well ([Security](security.md)) where you can.

## Two copies

The node works on its copy (an apply from the phone, an enroll). So:

```bash
kiwi-server control pull ~/kiwi/fleet.yaml    # before working here again
kiwi-server control push ~/kiwi/fleet.yaml    # after changing the fleet here
```

Each refuses to overwrite a side that changed since the last sync; `--force`
overrides. The node takes a push while it is open. A new password
(`--set-password`, then push) locks it until that password logs in.

## Mind

- Never put the module on a rented master: while it is unlocked, the machine
  holds every secret of the fleet in its memory.
- Nodes take SSH on their mesh address (`vpn-client: { mesh_ssh: false }`
  turns it off), keys only: that is how the control node reaches them from
  anywhere.
- `control: { allow_from: 192.168.0.0/16 }` opens the page to one more
  network, e.g. the home LAN.
