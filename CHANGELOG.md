# Changelog

## 2.1.0 — the kiwi-v2 modules, and GPL-3

- **Modules**: the kiwi-v2 module system lives in `modules/` and the renderer
  is part of the library (`kiwiserver.modules`): compose fragments are merged
  as YAML, the reverse proxy aggregates the blocks the other modules announce,
  module firewall rules flow into gluetun's post-rules, and a *bundle* of
  files, directories, ports, sysctls and host units is embedded into the role
  script. The host needs docker, nothing else.
- **Roles are module presets**: `master` (vpn-client, vpn-server, dns, tor),
  `node-gw` (vpn-client, dns, dhcp-relay, reverse-proxy, downloader, gateway,
  portainer, sftp), `node-cloud` (vpn-client, reverse-proxy, cloud, vault,
  portainer) — the live kiwi-master, kiwi-node-gw and kiwi-cloud, module by
  module. `modules:` in a host's block changes the list.
- **Settings from one place**: each `module.yaml` carries a `settings:` schema;
  validation, `kiwi-server roles -v` and the GUI's per-module groups come from
  it. Presets seed module settings with `module_defaults:`.
- **Filled in from the v2 TODO**: `start.sh` (double hop, isolated-client
  subnet) and `torrc` for the master, nginx server blocks per module, the
  gateway script with the live routing rules (table 128 with `throw`, LAN
  kept off the docker subnet), Pi-hole 6 variables, conditional WireGuard
  env vars for a custom config, DNAT to the proxy's real address.
- **New modules** the live setups ran but v2 lacked: `portainer`, `sftp`,
  `dhcp-relay`.
- **Fleet-wide knowledge**: every Pi-hole serves every host and service name
  at its mesh address (split-horizon DNS), the master's `start.sh` lets
  isolated clients reach every node, and one fleet CA (`kiwi-server ca`)
  issues `*.<hostname>` certificates for the reverse proxies and is trusted on
  every machine built.
- **On the host**: `kiwi-stack` (start, stop, restart, update, status, logs,
  vpn-restart), `kiwi-stack.service`, the daily VPN restart and weekly update
  timers the v1 cron jobs did, systemd-resolved's stub listener turned off
  where Pi-hole needs port 53, `docker compose config` validation at render.
- **License**: GPL-3.0-or-later, like the rest of the Kiwi Network apps.


## 2.0.0 — the kiwi-updater rewrite

A new tool under the old name. The 1.x script generated Fedora CoreOS ISOs from
a YAML file; 2.0 builds the machines of a Kiwi Network.

- **kiwi-updater app**: `kiwi.manifest`, `install.sh` (user scope, no root),
  `kiwi-server` CLI with bash completion and `kiwi-server-gui` (GTK4/libadwaita,
  app id `eu.kiwinetwork.KiwiServer`). `kiwi install kiwi-server` once it is in
  the catalog.
- **Three targets**: Fedora CoreOS (stable), uCore (CoreOS that rebases itself
  onto a `ghcr.io/ublue-os/ucore*` image on first boot) and Debian stable
  (trixie netinst, preseeded).
- **Roles** instead of a flat server list: `bare`, `node-cloud` (the kiwi-cloud
  stack: Nextcloud AIO, Vaultwarden, Portainer, nginx behind a gluetun
  WireGuard client) and `master` (wg-easy + Pi-hole baseline). A role is a
  directory with a `role.yaml` settings schema and an `apply.sh`; the schema
  validates the fleet file and builds the GUI form, so the reworked
  kiwi-node/kiwi-master drop in without GUI changes.
- **One role script per host**: self-contained bash, secrets embedded, run by
  `kiwi-role.service` on first boot — or by hand on any installed machine.
- **Unattended install media**: `coreos-installer iso customize --dest-device`
  for CoreOS/uCore; for Debian the preseed goes into the installer's initrd and
  the boot menus start the unattended entry, with `xorriso -boot_image any
  replay` keeping the stock BIOS/UEFI boot setup.
- **Automatic updates with a reboot window** on every target: Zincati
  `periodic` on CoreOS, staged rpm-ostree updates plus a reboot timer on uCore,
  unattended-upgrades plus a reboot-if-required timer on Debian.
- **Toolchain** runs natively when butane, coreos-installer and xorriso are
  installed, otherwise in a podman/docker image (`kiwi-server toolchain build`)
  — nothing is layered onto an ostree desktop.
- **Checks**: `validate` (exit 2 on errors), `doctor`, `show` (effective config,
  secrets masked), `--porcelain` JSON for the GUI; tests shellcheck every
  rendered script, validate every Butane config with `butane --strict`, and
  rebuild a mock Debian ISO.

Dropped from 1.x: the `global:`/`servers:` file format, the `kiwi-server-gen.sh`
wrapper and `iso ignition embed` (which only embedded a live config and still
asked you to run the installer). The per-server Butane extras (`files`,
`directories`, `systemd_units`, `services`, `kernel_arguments`, `luks`,
`boot_device`) live on under `coreos:`.

## 1.0.0

Initial release: Fedora CoreOS / uCore ISO generator from a YAML file.
